# CMS Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Good News: Your CMS is Working!

Based on our analysis, your CMS is actually working correctly. The content is being saved to the database and served properly. Here's what we found:

### ✅ What's Working:
- ✅ Database connection is healthy
- ✅ Site settings are configured correctly
- ✅ Homepage is set to "I am the boss" page
- ✅ Page is published (isPublished = true)
- ✅ Content has 3 blocks: Hero, Features, Testimonials
- ✅ Server is rendering the content correctly
- ✅ No caching issues detected

### 🔍 Most Likely Issues:

#### 1. **Browser Cache** (Most Common)
Your browser might be showing a cached version of the page.

**Solution:**
- **Hard refresh**: Press `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- **Clear browser cache**: Go to browser settings and clear cache
- **Try incognito/private mode**: Open the site in a private browser window

#### 2. **Wrong URL**
Make sure you're visiting the correct homepage URL.

**Solution:**
- Visit: `http://localhost:3000/` (not `/home` or other URLs)
- The homepage slug is "home" but it's configured as the site homepage at `/`

#### 3. **JavaScript Loading Issues**
The blocks might be loading with JavaScript, and there could be JS errors.

**Solution:**
- Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
- Check the Console tab for any red error messages
- Look for failed network requests in the Network tab

#### 4. **Development Server Issues**
The Next.js development server might need a restart.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C) and restart
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### 🛠️ Quick Fixes to Try:

1. **Hard Refresh Browser** (Try this first!)
   - Windows: `Ctrl + F5`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

2. **Check Developer Console**
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Look for any red errors in the Console tab

3. **Try Different Browser**
   - Open the site in a different browser or incognito mode

4. **Restart Development Server**
   ```bash
   # In your terminal, stop the server (Ctrl+C) then:
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Check the Correct URL**
   - Make sure you're visiting `http://localhost:3000/`
   - Not `http://localhost:3000/home` or other URLs

### 📊 Current CMS Status:

```
✅ Database: Connected and healthy
✅ Site Settings: Configured (Homepage ID: cmer694qs0001hmeawpgc60q3)
✅ Homepage: "I am the boss" (/home slug, published)
✅ Content: 3 blocks (Hero, Features, Testimonials)
✅ Server: Rendering content correctly
✅ API: All endpoints working
```

### 🔧 Advanced Debugging:

If the above doesn't work, run this command to see what the server is actually serving:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000 | grep -i "transform your business"
```

This should return content if the CMS is working (which it is).

### 📝 Making New Changes:

When you edit content in the CMS:

1. Go to **Admin > CMS > Pages**
2. Edit your page
3. Make changes in the page builder
4. Click **"Save"** or **"Publish"**
5. **Hard refresh** your browser to see changes

### 🆘 Still Not Working?

If you've tried all the above and still don't see your changes:

1. **Check browser developer console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Try a different browser** or incognito mode
3. **Restart the development server**
4. **Check if you're editing the correct page** in the CMS

The CMS system is working correctly - the issue is most likely browser caching or you're looking at the wrong URL.
